# face-recogntion
Developed a facial recognition-based attendance system using OpenCV and face_recognition library. The system captures live video from a webcam, processes facial encodings, and matches them with stored images of known individuals. Upon recognition, the system automatically logs the person's attendance with timestamp in a CSV file. Integrated features include real-time face detection, encoding comparison, and attendance marking, making it an efficient tool for automated attendance management.
